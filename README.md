<h2 align="center">Fetch and Care: A Pet Sitter Finder

<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>

 <p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pets are as special as our cute little babies. They also need the care that we give to our children. There are many cases just like in a normal family setup, parents are much likely to spend their time working outside. As a result, their children need someone to take care of them. This is also what our furbabies need. If you are traveling out of the city or country for a few days or weeks and cannot take your kids with you, you leave them at home with some relatives or hire a babysitter. This issue is also relevant for pet owners. Developing an app to help users find a person who would take care of pets while the owners are away would be a great help for pet owners and animal lovers alike.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By offering a handy platform where you can quickly and easily discover the ideal pet sitter for your furry pets, Fetch and Care: Pet Sitter Finder is made to make your life easier. Our app can help, whether you need someone to care for your pets while you're on vacation, through a busy workweek, or just for a few hours.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main goal of this application is to provide users with a Pet Sitter that will take care of their pets in a specific amount of time. When using the app, users will register and input their information. The users will be able to choose the Pet sitter and input how many hours their pet would like to be sit.
